The **International Space Station** (**ISS**) is a [space station](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Space_station "Space station"), or a habitable [artificial satellite](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Satellite), in [low Earth orbit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low_Earth_orbit "Low Earth orbit"). Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000.

## Purpose

According to the original [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memorandum_of_Understanding "Memorandum of Understanding") between NASA and Rosaviakosmos, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in [low Earth orbit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low_Earth_orbit). It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids.
